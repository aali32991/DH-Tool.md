Rebecca Thurber | Voyant | Text Analysis & Visualization | https://voyant-tools.org/ | "Web Services for Voyant: LINCS |  Voyant and NSSI: LINCS |  Voyant and NSSI" | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/11736 | None | I consider Voyant to be a DH tool because it is a web-based platform that allows the user to read and analyze digital texts. I have not used Voyant beyond randomly running a pdf through it to see what it looks like.
Yoonsuh Kim | Voyant | Text Analysis & Visualization | https://voyant-tools.org/ | "Remapping Leigh Hunt's Circles"": Voyant Tools and Hunt's Dramatic Criticism" | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/2621 | None | I have not used it before. Voyant is a DH tool for textual analysis.
Amoura Devina | Google Books | Digital Library | https://books.google.com/ | Negentropic linguistic evolution: A comparison of seven languages | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/6286 | Yes | "I used this tool in my own studies as a graduate student when I was earning my MA in English. It makes searching books for specific lines of text easy. It can also be used for other academic purposes. The linked abstract discusses this further and explains how Google Books can be used to study ""the entropy of language and its complexity."""
Sanchita Kamath | Scholarly 3D Toolkit | 3D Modeling & Visualization | https://digitalhumanities101.wordpress.com/2014/10/22/connecting-digital-humanities-data-with-the-scholarly-3d-toolkit/ | "The Scholarly 3D Toolkit: Annotation |  Publication |  and Analysis of 3D Scenes alongside Imported Humanities Data" | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/2111 | None | "This tool can help modulate details about events and monuments into 3D environments by adding metadata |  which I found really interesting. I do not any experience using the tool |  and my knowledge about it is limited to the textual description on the weblink and a video posted on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtW29vqyJcM about this work as explained by the author. This is a 'DH Tool' because of its ability to represent cultural data (mined from ancient texts) to a spatial environment for easy visualization."
Richard Schneider | Pallido | Network Analysis & Visualization  | http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/about/ |  Mapping the Republic of Letters project | http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/ | None | "I consider this a DH tool because it takes analysis that would be done in small |  laborous chunks over time by many researchers to tease apart correspondance groupings. So this is then technology that extends that framework to look at more information in similar ways. Instead of a network analysis of researchers at Oxford 1630-1650 (significantly limiting scope) |  the tool helps answer questions about how the communities were connected and identifies potential areas for future research. So someone could isolate a different communal subset |  timeperiod |  or information to create a new set of critical editions to better understand the history."
Katherine Fata | Story Map | Data Visualization & Storytelling | https://storymap.knightlab.com/ | Southern Literary Trail | https://www.georgiahumanities.org/southern-literary-trail-story-map/ | None | "I became aware of this tool because I often use |  or embed |  DH tools at my full-time job |  where I am a production editor for an open-access scholarly publishing platform. While I haven't used this tool specifically in my work |  its often one that we throw around |  as well as their Timeline.JS tool which maps stories into timelines! I think its a really strong DH tool because it is so user-friendly |  and is easily applicable to a breadth of different projects."
Amina Ali | TEI | Text Encoding and Markup Standards | https://tei-c.org/ | Early Modern Songscapes |  https://mith.umd.edu/research/early-modern-soundscapes/ | None | "Since 1994 |  libraries |  museums |  publishers |  and individual scholars have used the TEI Guidelines to present texts for online research |  teaching |  and preservation. In summary |  TEI is a foundational tool in the digital humanities. It provides a standardized and structured approach to encoding textual data |  enabling researchers to digitally work with |  analyze |  and preserve textual materials. This DH tool enhances the accessibility and analytical capabilities of humanities scholars |  making it an essential tool in this field while facilitating collaboration among diverse institutions and researchers."
Austin Pollock | Twitter (X) | Digital Library (Data Collection from Social Media) | twitter.com | "Project Twitter Literature: Scraping |  Analyzing |  and Archiving Twitter Data in Literary Research" | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/9425 | Yes | "I hadn't thought of Twitter as an explicitly DH tool |  but it is a digital tool that has many uses for those in the humanities. I use its search function |  sometimes tagged with a user's @ |  to search for opinions and discussions about authors |  books |  and other literary topics."
Inyoung Jang | Python | Programming Language | https://www.python.org/https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/11841 | A code for Murakami’s Tokyo: spatial diversity analyzed by digital means | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/11841 | Yes | "Python can be used for multiple purposes. In this research |  the author used Python with Natural Language Processing to tokenize |  tag |  and parse corpus from the chosen document and extract spatial data concerning the cognitive mapping of the document. This helps distance reading effectively |  widens understanding of the document along with the social and cultural aspects |  and opens up further discussion. I have used Python for basic metadata sorting and extracting. Still |  I’m a beginner at this tool and want to learn more about this tool for my future work."
Phil Torchia | WordPress | Web Content Management | https://wordpress.com/home/tenweeks716798793.wordpress.com | "WordPress as a framework for automated data capture |  filtering and structuring processes. The new order of the authors" | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/2822 | Yes | "I consider this to be a ""DH tool"" because |  as a web content management system |  this digital tool can assist humanists in organizing work around publishing |  media collections |  and hosting discussion forums. To support WordPress as a DH tool |  I have discovered and noted that academic libraries include WordPress within their Digital Humanities tools and resources LibGuides. Also |  the co-authors of the short paper |  ""WordPress as a framework for automated data capture |  filtering |  and structuring processes. The new order of the authors "" |  Cruces-Rodriguez |  Rodriguez Ortega |  and Polo used WordPress as a framework for other digital work such as web interaction |  data extraction |  and delivering structured data to a variety of data-analysis-based systems. This tells me that while WordPress may not be doing the data processing |  it can provide a workflow framework to organize and guide other digital tasks."
Elizabeth Watkins | Scalar | Multimedia Digital Publications | http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar | Access to DH Pedagogy as the Norm: Introducing Students to DH Methods Across the Curriculum and at a Distance | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/3879 | None | "I consider Scalar to be a DH tool because it is a software for publishing and linking multimedia scholarship on digital platforms. I do not have previous experience using it |  which is one of the reasons I picked it for this assignment. I do have experience with Omeka |  which is another DH publishing tool."
Isabelle Cheng | Drupal | Web Content Management | https://www.drupal.org/ | "Bibliopedia |  Linked Open Data |  and the Web of Scholarly Citations" | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/1610 | Yes | "I took the music librarianship course last semester |  and one of the music databases we studied used the Islandora repository system |  which is based on Drupal. I would like to learn more about this management system!"
Ruby Martinez | Gephi | Network Analysis & Visualization  | https://gephi.org/ | Preliminaries: The Social Networks of Literary Production in the Spanish Empire During the Administration of the Duke of Lerma (1598-1618) | https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/1762 | None | "I haven't used Gephi before |  but I've come across projects where it has been utilized. I think it's a helpful DH tool given its capabilities in network analysis and visualizations."
